        <p>
            Mars, the Red Planet, has captivated human imagination for centuries. Its reddish hue comes from iron oxide (rust) on its surface. Mars has a 
            thin atmosphere, mostly carbon dioxide, and is home to the tallest volcano (Olympus Mons) and the largest canyon (Valles Marineris) in the Solar System.
        </p>
        <p>
            Mars is a prime candidate for the search for past or present life due to evidence of ancient rivers, lakes, and oceans. Robotic explorers like the 
            Perseverance Rover are studying its surface to uncover its secrets.
        </p>
        <h2>Formation and Structure of Mars</h2>
        <p>
            Mars likely formed from the accretion of rocky materials and retains traces of its volcanic and fluvial past. Its structure includes:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Core:</strong> Likely iron-sulfur, partially molten.</li>
                <li><strong>Mantle:</strong> Silicate materials with inactive tectonics.</li>
                <li><strong>Crust:</strong> Covered in iron oxide, giving it a reddish hue.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h2>Significance</h2>
        <p>
            Marsâ€™s history of water makes it a prime target for studying potential past life and future human colonization.
        </p>
        <h2>Fun Facts</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Mars has two small moons, Phobos and Deimos, thought to be captured asteroids.</li>
            <li>A Martian year is 687 Earth days, while a day is just slightly longer than an Earth day (24 hours and 37 minutes).</li>
            <li>Dust storms on Mars can engulf the entire planet and last for weeks.</li>
        </ul>
